  content: [
    "As researchers in the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Science Engineering at IIT Ropar, we focus on in-situ deformation studies. Utilizing techniques like transmission electron microscopy (TEM), synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and digital image correlation (DIC), we analyze structures and measure deformation across a diverse range of materials to address critical engineering challenges.",
    "Our research spans from traditional steel, aluminum, copper, and titanium alloys with well-established properties to complex high/medium entropy alloys (HEA/MEA) and transformation/twin-induced plasticity (TRIP/TWIP) alloys that offer unique combinations of strength and ductility, with applications ranging from advanced automotive components to cutting-edge tools for the petrochemical industry.",
    "In contrast to this modern approach, we also delve into archaeometallurgy, analyzing ancient metal artifacts and techniques to understand the evolution of metals and their properties."
