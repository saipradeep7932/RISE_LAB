    title: "Designing materials based on TRIP & TWIP mechanisms",
    content: "Achieving high strength and ductility in structural materials is challenging, as conventional strengthening methods often lead to early plastic instability. However, certain alloys with recrystallized structures can overcome this trade-off by activating unexpected deformation modes, such as <c + a> dislocations in Mg alloys, nano twins in high-Mn steels, and deformation-induced martensite in metastable austenitic steels. These mechanisms enhance strain hardening, delay instability, and improve mechanical properties. Inspired by these strategies, our research applies the concept of sequential nucleation of deformation modes to medium manganese steels for automotive applications and refractory complex concentrated alloys for rocket thrust applications, aiming to optimize both strength and ductility in these advanced materials.",

    title: "Understanding materials properties based on mis-fit volume",
    content: "The effect of misfit volume on material properties plays a crucial role in strengthening mechanisms, particularly in high-entropy and complex concentrated alloys (CCAs). Solute misfit volumes influence dislocation movement, impacting yield strength by introducing local lattice distortions. While conventional strengthening theories primarily consider solute misfit effects, recent studies suggest that solute–solute interactions also contribute to additional strengthening. In our research, we are studying different combinations of alloys with varying misfit properties to explore their impact on strengthening. This understanding helps optimize alloy design by leveraging misfit-induced strengthening for improved mechanical performance.",

    title: "Archaeometallurgy – Ancient Materials",
    content: "Archaeometallurgy is crucial for understanding India's rich metallurgical history, especially wootz steel. Analyzing artifacts like the Kondapalli sword reveals sophisticated ancient manufacturing processes, including crucible melting and lamination, and how material properties are tailored, like the hardness of sword blades. India's innovations, like Wootz steel (1–2% C), influenced global metalworking. Studying slag and elemental compositions illuminates early iron production (e.g., bloomery process) and raw materials. These investigations highlight the advanced skills of ancient Indian metallurgists and connect technological advancements with cultural and historical contexts, enriching our understanding of civilization.",

    title: "Univariant Steels",
    content: "Manufacturing of steel car bodies has evolved significantly since the 1960s, transitioning from mild steel to advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) for improved crash safety and fuel efficiency. However, the complexity of using multiple steel grades poses challenges in joining, processing, and recycling. This research introduces a novel concept: using a single compositional (unified) steel for body-in-white (BIW) manufacturing. By leveraging phase transformations through controlled alloying and thermomechanical processing, a single steel composition can achieve diverse mechanical properties, simplifying production while maintaining strength, toughness, and sustainability.",

    title: "High Strength & High Conductivity Copper",
    content: "Copper is widely used in electrical applications, requiring alloys with both high strength and conductivity. However, the strength–conductivity paradox remains a major challenge, as traditional strengthening methods degrade conductivity. Current strategies, like gradient and bimodal structures, offer compromises rather than true solutions. Inspired by nature, our approach optimizes ultrafine-grained (UFG) structures along the wire axis, potentially enhancing both strength and conductivity simultaneously.",
